Assignment 11: Note Takes

This assignment asked us to modify starter code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

The applicationâ€™s front end came created, so we had to create the back end and deploy it to Heroku.
